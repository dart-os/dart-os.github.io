        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are completely committed to maintaining the integrity and independence of <strong>Dart OS</strong>, and we firmly think that it can do so by drawing support from its community alone. Our method of fundraising is dependent on the generosity of people and groups that share our goal and are ready to make any contribution they can, no matter how small.<br><br>
        
        By making an investment in Dart OS, you'll provide us the freedom to continue improving and growing our distribution without being diverted by for-profit endeavours or other sources of income. We kindly welcome you to take part in this campaign by making a donation to <strong>Dart OS</strong> and informing people who might be interested in helping our project about it.</p>
